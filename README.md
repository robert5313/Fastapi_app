API (Application Programming Interface) are the backbone of modern architecture because they allow for applications to be modular and decoupled. This means that you can build applications built quickly and easily, allowing you to easily maintain and update them. 

APIs are also very important in machine learning because they allow different applications to share data and work together, saving time and effort. There are many different frameworks for building APIs in Python. Some of the most popular frameworks for creating APIs in Python are Django, Flask, and FastAPI. This tutorial is a deep dive into one of the frameworks called FastAPI.
What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. When you use an application on your phone, the application connects to the Internet and sends data to a server. The server then processes the data and sends it back to your phone. The application on your phone then interprets the data and presents it to you in a readable way. 

An API is like a waiter in a restaurant. The waiter takes your order and sends it to the kitchen. The kitchen then prepares the food and sends it back to the waiter. The waiter then brings the food to you. 

In the same way, an API takes a request from an application and sends it to a server. The server then processes the request and sends the data back to the application. The application then interprets the data and presents it to the user.
